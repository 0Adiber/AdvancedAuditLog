# AdvancedAuditLog
A Discord Bot that gives you advanced audit log of your server.

## How it works?
1. Create a ```config.json``` and paste everything from the ```example-config.json``` file (or just rename it)
2. Set the settings you like
3. Get yourself a Bot at [Discord Developer](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/ "Discord Developer Applications Page")
	* Get yourself an application
	* Get a Bot
	* Get the Token for it -> paste it in the config
4. Finished

> Obviously you need to host the server somewhere and invite it to your server (the Internet is very helpful for the latter)
